# NN-from-scratch
### Building Neural Network from scratch and using sigmoid activation function on hidden-layers, while using soft-max activation function on just the output layer.

### Adding a regularization hyper-parameter that controls the overfitting phenomenon while training the model.

### The model is created using only NumPy from end-to-end. and trained on mnist dataset by extracting some features from it before feeding it to the model.

### The extracted features are splitting the images into 7 * 7 sub-images then extract the centroid or momentum of each sub-image, and get its coordinates (X,Y) and consider ### them as the new features.
