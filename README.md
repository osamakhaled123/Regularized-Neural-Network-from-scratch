# NN-from-scratch
## Building Neural Network from scratch and using sigmoid activation function on hidden-layers, while using soft-max activation function on just the output layer.

## adding a regularization parameter that controls the overfitting phenomenon while training the model.

## The model is created using only NumPy from end-to-end. and trained on mnist dataset.
